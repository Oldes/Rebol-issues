# The Official Rebol Issue Tracker

Welcome to the future home for the Rebol 3 issue tracker, supporting the
development of Rebol 3. We are in the process of migrating from our previous
[CureCode instance](http://curecode.org/rebol3/) to Github. This migration aims
to preserve the valuable history and open issues from CureCode.

Please continue to use CureCode until the migration is completed. This Github
repository may be deleted and created afresh until then; so any issues create
_here_ during that period will be lost.

Once the migration is finished, we'll remove this disclaimer.

Thanks for bearing with us!

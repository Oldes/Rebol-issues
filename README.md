### Welcome
Welcome to the Rebol 3 issue tracker, supporting the
development of Rebol 3. We have now completed the migration from our previous
[CureCode instance](http://curecode.org/rebol3/) to Github.

The issues are in this repository under the issues tab:

https://github.com/rebol/rebol-issues/issues

### Using github issues for curecode users
TBC

1. @rebolbot imported everything. How do I seach for issues that I raised? 
  * Try the following search `is:issue is:open "Submitted by: ladislav" in:body`
2. Can I edit my issues which have been imported from curecode?
  * Unfortunately as @rebolbot imported and owns all of the tickets you cannot edit your old tickets. Any new tickets or comments on existing tickets will be editable as expected.
